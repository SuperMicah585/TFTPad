# Server Reliability Improvements

## Problem
The Flask server was experiencing random 500 Internal Server Errors, particularly with:
- `/api/users/<user_id>/study-groups` endpoint
- `/api/user-riot-account/<user_id>` endpoint

These errors were caused by:
1. **Supabase connection issues** - `[Errno 35] Resource temporarily unavailable`
2. **Network connectivity problems**
3. **Database query timeouts**
4. **Lack of proper error handling and retry logic**

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Server-Side Improvements (Flask Backend)

#### Enhanced Error Handling
- Added comprehensive logging with `logging` module
- Implemented retry logic for Supabase queries with exponential backoff
- Added detailed error messages and proper HTTP status codes

#### Retry Logic for Database Queries
```python
def execute_supabase_query_with_retry(query_func, max_retries=3, delay=1):
    """
    Execute a Supabase query with retry logic for connection issues
    """
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            result = query_func()
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            # Check if it's a connection-related error
            if any(keyword in str(e).lower() for keyword in ['connection', 'timeout', 'unavailable', 'network']):
                if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                    time.sleep(delay)
                    delay *= 2  # Exponential backoff
                    continue
            else:
                # Non-connection error, don't retry
                raise e
```

#### Improved Health Check Endpoint
- Enhanced `/health` endpoint to test Supabase connectivity
- Returns detailed status including database connection state
- Helps identify when the server is having connection issues

### 2. Client-Side Improvements (React Frontend)

#### Retry Logic in Service Layer
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff to all API calls
- Implemented in both `studyGroupService.ts` and `userService.ts`
- Retries on 5xx errors but not on 4xx client errors

#### Configuration
```typescript
const RETRY_CONFIG = {
  maxRetries: 3,
  baseDelay: 1000,
  maxDelay: 10000,
};
```

### 3. Monitoring and Recovery

#### Health Check Script
- Created `health_check.py` to monitor server health
- Automatically restarts server if it becomes unhealthy
- Logs all health check results and restart attempts

#### Usage
```bash
# Run the health check monitor
python health_check.py

# Or run it in the background
nohup python health_check.py > health_check.log 2>&1 &
```

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Downtime**: Automatic retry logic handles temporary connection issues
2. **Better User Experience**: Users see fewer errors and faster recovery
3. **Improved Monitoring**: Detailed logging helps identify root causes
4. **Automatic Recovery**: Health check script can restart the server if needed
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Server continues to function even with partial database issues

## Monitoring

### Server Logs
The Flask server now logs:
- All API requests with user IDs
- Database query attempts and results
- Connection errors and retry attempts
- Health check results

### Health Check Logs
The health check script logs:
- Health check results every 30 seconds
- Server restart attempts
- Connection failures and recovery

## Best Practices

1. **Always check server logs** when experiencing issues
2. **Monitor the health check logs** for patterns
3. **Consider increasing retry limits** if connection issues persist
4. **Monitor Supabase service status** for external issues
5. **Set up alerts** for repeated health check failures

## Troubleshooting

### If you're still seeing 500 errors:

1. **Check server logs** for detailed error messages
2. **Test the health endpoint**: `curl http://localhost:5001/health`
3. **Check Supabase status** at https://status.supabase.com
4. **Restart the server** manually if needed
5. **Run the health check script** to monitor automatically

### Common Error Messages:

- `[Errno 35] Resource temporarily unavailable` - Network connectivity issue
- `Database connection failed after 3 attempts` - Supabase service issue
- `Failed to fetch user study groups` - Client-side retry exhausted

## Future Improvements

1. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevent cascading failures
2. **Connection Pooling**: Better database connection management
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse
4. **Metrics Collection**: Track error rates and response times
5. **Alerting**: Notify when server becomes unhealthy
